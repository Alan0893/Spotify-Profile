# Spotify

- Utilizes the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) API to obtain a User, Artists, Album, Playlist, Tracks, and Player information.

- Utilizes the [TicketMaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/) API to get an Artist's upcoming events


## Usage
To start the frontend client:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
To start the backend server:
```
cd server
npm install
node index
```
Since the backend utilizes the build folder, in the frontend client:
```
npm run build
```
